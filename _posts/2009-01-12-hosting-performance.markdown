So as I was making some posts and doing some backend work within wordpress I noticed some really slow requests... If you browse my blog what do you think about the performance? I hadn't had complaints before and I wonder if something is going on right now (shared hosting...)

Amidst the fray I'm thinking more and more about hosting myself. I've migrated one of my clients partially to this host so I could use php 5+ but am reluctant to move them completely here if the performance isn't really there.

I like the prices available @ <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/" target="_blank">slicehost</a>. It will require me to secure &amp; me to monitor etc etc but it is probably worth the performance increase and unshared hosting.
