I just noticed this was added to my sociable plugin, but I have to say it is definitely a great concept and it is one of those things that makes you wonder why it took so long to come about. I would use this any day over some browser plugin, the less crap to fill up my browser that it wasn't intended for the better. The coolest part is being able to remove any content in the url and print your modified version of the page.
