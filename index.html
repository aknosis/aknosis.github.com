        About
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have always been a fan of technology. I can remember my family's first computer at 5 years old, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PCjr">IBM PCjr</a>. All I can recall with that computer is playing games that were inserted via cartridges.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I got older I was exposed to more complex games that my Grandpa would play. 
        Civilization, Railroad Tycoon, Sim City, Might and Magic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic
        Silent Service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Service_(video_game),
        Eye of the Beholder.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)

        And probably a dozen others I can't remember.
      </p>
       . Growing up my friends had computers and we played computer games all the time. One of our favorite games was everquest, and online anymore RPG. I spent about a year after graduating high school not working much and playing a lot of your reques. After starting a full-time job I realize I didn't have much time to play the game, that's when I discovered an online marketplace where I could sell my account that I wasn't playing anymore. Turns out you could also sell items you found in game. On my off time I would play and sell items for some extra money, through this I learned basic HTML and listed items for sale with PayPal links on my cable isps shared hosting. 6 months or so later I started going to MCC and started working on my associates degree in web development. After graduating from MCC I didn't see the industry (naively)For web development/design so when I transferred to ASU I decided to work on my bachelor's in  computer system administration. After graduating ASU I started as a sister administrator at Celsius, slowly I transitioned into a developer and eventually wound up excelling so well that I became a full-time developer. I spent eight years at Celsius growing with the company from six employees to over 50 when they were acquired by our logic. I worked at higher logic for a year before realizing my desire to work in smaller companies and where my work can have larger impact. In 2018 I started work at a reload and have been here ever since.
